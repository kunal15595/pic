* ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* Code Tested on:
* Explorer 16 Demo board with  PIC24FJ128GA010 controller
*
* DESCRIPTION:
* This code example shows on how to use ADC on PIC24F. Here I used two light up LED chasing one another through D3 TO D7 LED. 
* One I called user LED (brighter) and the other is the chased LED (dimmer). Once the chased LED hits by the user LED the chased LED
* will move to the right of user LED. Variable resistor R6 us used to move the user LED and hit the chased LED.
* Once the chased LED is in dead end (D3)and hits by user LED it will move on the first LED which is D10.
* Initially the position of chased LED is in random.
